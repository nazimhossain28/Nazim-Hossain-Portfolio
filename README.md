# Md. Nazim Hossain

Hello! I'm Nazim. I pursued my B.Sc. degree in Textile Engineering with a major in Yarn Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX). My academic and practical experiences have focused on developing sustainable products in the textile industry. My thesis centered on developing rotor melange yarns from textile waste via an upcycling process.

### 📜 Academic Projects
#### Quality assessment of upcycled waste/Cotton blend rotor yarn and optimization modeling using Taguchi Design of Experiment.
  Developed yarns from brushed fiber (from the sueding process) and Droppings-I (waste from the ring-spinning process). Using the Taguchi method, a model was created to optimize the quality of upcycled yarn, an approach that proved both sustainable and cost-effective by eliminating the dyeing process.
